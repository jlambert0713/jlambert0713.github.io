				<p>Welcome to Harpe Gaming. We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:<br /></p>
					<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
						<li>* Unplug</li>
						<li>* Interact</li>
						<li>* Reconnect</li>
					</ul>
			
		
				<p>And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones 
				that bring people together through shared experiences. With 
				all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get
				that from a computer screen. Sometimes you need the 
				intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around 
				a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.</p>

				<p>We are a local board and card game store located in the 
				heart of Morgantown near the campus. We carry 
				hundreds of games and puzzles, including educational games, family games, card games, historical 
				simulations, role-playing games, and so much more. 
				If you remember a great game from your youth, we 
				probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.</p>

				<p>We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate 
				gaming and the company of good friends. 
				Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out 
				a game from our demo library and start playing. 
				We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special 
				social events. You'll always find a game to play.</p>

				<p>We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We 
				publish periodic reviews of new titles. Just out 
				our reviews of Towers and Temples and Alliance; both 
				new this month at Harpe Gaming.</p>
